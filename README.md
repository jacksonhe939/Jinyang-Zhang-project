# Jinyang-Zhang-project
This project is used  I/O multiplexing knowledge, One is for server and the other one is for client, this program can let user login first, then user can create their file and upload or download the files they want. Traditional blocking method, one time can only deal with one request and the server side could stuck there cause waiting for client to send requests. With  I/O multiplexing  server can accept multiple requests at same time and also won't be stuck there waiting the requests
